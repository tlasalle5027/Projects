            <h2>My Bio:</h2>
            <p>Hi. and welcome to my portfolio!</p>
            <p>My name is Thomas LaSalle, and I am currently teaching myself Web and Mobile 
            Development through a combination of CodeCademy, as well as other various resources.
             In fact, this portfolio website was built from the ground-up with the knowledge I have gained
            working with CodeCademy.</p>
            <p>In addition to a budding developer, I consider myself of the entrepreneurial type, having started a self
                proprietorship called <a href="https://www.cfmsoftware.com">CFM Software</a>, where I aim to release larger
                mobile and web application development projects to allow me to grow as a developer, while providing useful
                and entertaining tools for people to use.</p>
